# NoteVerse 🌍  
*Knowledge shared. Success multiplied.*

NoteVerse is a global, collaborative platform that enables students to **share and access class notes**, helping each other succeed while earning rewards for their contributions.

---

## 🚀 Project overview

NoteVerse solves two common problems in student life:
- Missing or incomplete notes due to absences or academic overload.
- Lack of recognition for students who consistently take quality notes.

We aim to create a balanced knowledge-sharing ecosystem — **students help each other, earn points**, and access valuable academic content securely and ethically.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Democratize access to quality class notes.
- Encourage a culture of mutual academic support.
- Reward students who share useful, well-organized content.
- Make knowledge accessible across languages, institutions, and borders.
- Ensure ethical use and secure handling of student contributions.

## ⚙️ How it works ?

### 1. Student registration  
Users sign up, select their academic institution, program, and preferred language.

### 2. Contributing notes  
Students upload notes they personally took — scanned, typed, or handwritten — with metadata:
- Subject
- Date
- Language
- Level of study

Each upload is reviewed through **automated and/or peer moderation**.

### 3. Points & rewards  
Contributors earn **points** for validated uploads, which can be exchanged for:
- Access to other users’ notes
- Digital perks, gift cards, badges, or monetary incentives

### 4. Accessing notes  
Users spend points to unlock notes, using filters such as:
- Subject
- Language
- Date
- Quality rating
- Verified contributors
